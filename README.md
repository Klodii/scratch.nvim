# Scratch

This is a neovim plugin that opens a new tab with a scratch markdown buffer,
which can't be saved.
Every time you open the Scratch tab you open the same buffer, so no data is
lost until you close nvim.

It is useful if you want to write down some ideas in a draft manner and then
tresh them.


Scratch is a Neovim plugin that opens a new tab with a scratch Markdown buffer,
which cannot be saved.

Every time you open the Scratch tab, it reopens the same buffer, ensuring that
no data is lost until you close Neovim.

This plugin is useful for jotting down quick ideas or drafts that you don't need
to save and may want to discard later.
